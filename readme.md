# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start both the backend and the frontend, either:
1. run `docker-compose up`
2. use: `./start.sh`

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.
